	// Place your testing workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"scope": "php",
		"prefix": "test",
		"body": [
			"/** @test*/ \npublic function ${1:can_}(){\n\t${2:#new test}\n}",
			
		],
		"description": "create new test function"
	}
